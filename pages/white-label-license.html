<h1 id="whitelabellicence">White Label Licence</h1>

<p>A white label licence (or re-seller licence) enables you to take the system and remove all credits from the existing
    developer, thus making the software appear as your own. The cost of the white label licence is not cheap, but its a
    lot cheaper than hiring a programmer to build something from scratch. If you are good at marketing and can sell the
    software you`ll soon recuperate the costs and be on your way to making lots of money. </p>

<p>The main features are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Remove all references to A&amp;M Digital Technologies or AMDT,LLC</li>

    <li>Sell the system as your own at any price on any website</li>

    <li>Get a great system at a very low price. Cheaper than hiring a programmer.</li>

    <li>100% source code access</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="doigetanysupport">Do I get any support?</h2>

<p>Basic support is covered by the standard licence and the 12 month priority support. You can renew the priority
    support after 12 months if you wish. Note that not support is offered for custom changes made to the system after
    the licence is purchased. If you break something you will have to fix it yourself.</p>
